# maze-generator-results-2
The repository contains generated rectangular mazes. Labyrinths have an entrance and an exit. They are generated in JSON format.
The name of the file includes the difficulty of the maze (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD, EXTREME) as well as the height h and width w.

The repository will usually contain EXTREME labyrinths, because generating them takes a long time. On average, the correct labyrinth is generated once in a million attempts.
